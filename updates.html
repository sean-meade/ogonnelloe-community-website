                <p class="news-paragraph">The latest undertaking from the GAA club is the new development project for the club grounds. What is the development project you ask? Oh nothing, just an all-weather 40mx20m indoor centre.</p>
                <p class="news-paragraph">This will be an essential facility for underpinning the future of hurling and camogie in our community, but its uses will go way beyond that as it becomes a centre, too, for a wide range of healthy activity options and activities across the parish, from pre-school children to our older citizens. Critically, it will also double as a PE facility for our local National School, becoming the first such indoor facility of this scale available to any national school in our county.</p>

                <p class="news-paragraph">A huge thank you to everyone who bought and sold tickets over the last few months and who supported us throughout this entire process. It is a fantastic boost to the funding drive for our planned Development Project for the benefit of the Community and the National School, as well as the Camogie and Hurling Clubs.</p>
