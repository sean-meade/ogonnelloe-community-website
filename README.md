### Ogonnelloe GAA Website
---
[View the live project here.](https://sean-meade.github.io/ogonnelloe-community-website/)

This is a website project for the members of the GAA in the community of Ogonnelloe. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for current or potential members. This website was built for my first project for the softwre development course for code institute.

OgonnelloeGAA.com is a site that hopes to end the confusion for players. Growing up there has always been confusion about training times, events, and news about the club. What time is training? 8pm ... John said it was 7pm this week. When is that fundraiser on? Mam said it was Saturday week but Dad swears it was Friday. Who won player of the match there on the weekend? Susan ... No way had to be Elaine! 

This has been a common acurance. So OgonnelloeGAA.com is set to remove all doubts. It has an input field for email sign up for the newsletter, which contains the upcoming events. The Training page lays out the training times for the club for the different age groups. The news and events page lays out some of the top stories involving the club currently. Finally, there is a contact page to make it easy to request information from the club. Players are just going to have to find other things to argue over because all their questions will be answered!

The orignal scope for this website was to be a community website. Due to content availability I have to pivot. So I have decided to focus on one corner stone of our community of Ogonnelloe; the Gaielge Athletic Association (GAA).

## Design
I want the design of the website to inform and empower the vistors to access useable information relating to Ogonnelloe GAA. I want to keep the design and navigation simple to ensure it is accessable for all ages. I want to make the site responsive in order for it to be accessable on a range of devices. I want to make this website a tool for people to use to get more involved in the GAA club of Ogonnlloe. 

- ### Colour Scheme
	- The primary and secondary colours I have chosen to use are black (`#FFC125`) and amber (`#000000`). These are the colours on the Ogonnelloe flag. These colours are very bold so I wanted to offset this with a light colour to highlight certain areas. This colour was light grey (`#D2D5DD`).
  - The amber colour was found using the color selector on chrome dev tools. I used the selector to find the shade of each color that I felt complimented the site well and fitted with the bands look. ![Colour Pallette used in ths website](readme-imgs/colour-pallette.png "Colour Pallette used in ths website")
- ### Typography
	- The Celtic font from fontzip.com is used for the Logo. Patua One is used for all headings with Arial as a web safe backup font. Both fonts are very strong, supportive (to the rest of the content) and impactful which mirror the ethos of Ogonnellow GAA.For the body text the font Merriweather was chosen with serif as backup. Both being clean and precise as only Ogonnelloe can be!
- ### Imagery
	- The banner image is of very reckoniable hillside in Ogonnelloe. It is both familiar to residents of Ogonnelloe and welcoming to new potential members.

## Appendix

### Wireframes

#### Home Page Wireframe

Notes: I added a Google maps iframe just before the footer. This shows Ogonnelloe on the map. I chose to add this because it was useful and added to homepage. 

![Homepage Page Wireframe](readme-imgs/homepage-wireframe.jpg "Homepage Wireframe")

[Back to Wireframe Section](#wireframes)

#### Training Page Wireframe

Notes: I changed the contact information to the right hand side as it looks better and on mobile the crest (on the left) is on top. The crest was also chosen instead of Google maps because it is already in the homepage.

#### News Page Wireframe

Notes: A video banner was added to give more of an impression when first visiting the news page. I chose to have images on top of text because I thought it looked cleaner and fitted in more with the spacious flow of the site. Decided to just call it news and have one title rather then split it because it fitted in more with the spacious flow of the site.
